# EVVM - ElementarViewViewModel
 EVVM is a customized version of the Elementary package, designed with significant modifications to better suit personal preferences.

# Features
 * Introduction of DoubleEntityStateNotifierBuilder and TripleEntityStateNotifierBuilder for more dynamic state management.
 * The removal of ElementaryModel to streamline the architecture.
 * Addition of BuildContext directly into the widget for improved context handling.

# Reasons for Creation
The original Elementary package, while robust, contained aspects that did not align with my personal preferences. EVVM was created as a tailored solution, incorporating changes that enhance usability and align with my development philosophy.
